    <h1>How To Make A Cool Webpage</h1>
    <p>Here's how to make a cool first webpage:</p>
    <h2>Add Headings</h2>
    <p>A nice-looking HTML webpage nees some headings. You may choose from heading levels 1-3 (as a best practice, although you may go further).</p>
    <h2>Add Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Nice webpages do not only have headings, else, everything on the internet would look like my 85-year old Grandma's computer. Adding some paragraphs in there lets you keep everything looking nicely formatted.</p>
    <h3>Add Images</h3>
    <p>Know what else makes a webpage stand out? Images, like this one.</p>
